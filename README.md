# SPA.js
Single Page Application (SPA) Simplified Front-End Framework/Library. Visit https://spa.js.org/ for more details.

# Why?
SPA JS is built on the popular paradigm “KISS” (Keep It Simple, Stupid) that emphasizes on keeping a framework simple and not complicating it. Ideally a powerful framework should do all the heavy lifting and must make it easy for the developers to focus on the product features and not the framework. The SPA JS framework is powerful yet simple to learn, easy to adapt and easy to scale. A component developed once can easily be deployed in any other SPA application without complex configurations. Give it a try, you will love it.
